# MNIST-Classifier

Hey Guys,
This is my first Machine Learning Project.
The Project deals with classifiying digits written by people of diverse handwriting.

Requirements for Running the script:
1: Python3
2: sklearn
          Procedure for installing sklearn library:
          a)Install anaconda on your OS:
                                        sudo pip3 install conda
          b)Install sklearn:
                                        conda install sklearn[all-deps]
                                        This command will initiate installation of sklearn,numpy,scipy,pandas and all other dependencies of                                         sklearn.

Running the scipt:
1:You can use any IDE that supports python3.
2:Just compile the program and you might see an accuracy of above 85% in the classification of digits.
